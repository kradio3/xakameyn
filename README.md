### Goals
Implement a PID controller to maneuver the vehicle around the track!

### Description
I've used two PID controllers: one for angle and second for throttle control. Both tuned manually. I've extended ``I``` parameter: it has coefficient and range of integration

Total error calculated by angle controller going directly as angle correction factor.

Total error from throttle controller subtracting from this function:

If car will go faster - throttle will smoothly close.

The final equation is:

![Throttle function](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?Throttle&space;=&space;\frac{5}{(0.05\cdot&space;speed&space;&plus;&space;0.8)}&space;-&space;1&space;-&space;E_{throttle})
